The purpose of this demo is to showcase how you can build a Conversational AI application that engages users in natural language interactions, mimicking human conversation through natural language processing using [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/).

Examples of where you would see this type of application include: virtual assistants for tasks like answering queries and controlling smart devices, educational tutors for personalized learning, healthcare advisors for medical information, and entertainment chat bots for engaging conversations and games.

These applications aim to enhance user experiences by offering efficient and intuitive interactions, reducing the need for human intervention in various tasks and services.
